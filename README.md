TinyTcp is a simple implementation of TCP & FTP. It was written by
Geoffrey Cooper (AKA Geof Cooper, or Geoffrey H. Cooper) in 1986.

The original release was described as “public domain”, but that was used
in the sense of being publicly available, and not in the sense of
abandoning copyright. The original license terms allowed only
non-commercial redistribution (unless you sought further permission).

Much later, the author was asked to relicense this old software, under a
proper open source license. On 2023-07-21, Geoffrey Cooper said:

So, today, you can use TinyTcp under the MIT License. Note that we have
kept the original license information for historical accuracy.
Nonetheless, we want to be clear that you can use the MIT License (and
probably should!).

With this context in mind, you may wish to read the [original
README](README).

Finally, of note, Erick Engelke’s
[WATTCP](https://web.archive.org/web/20000816070410/http://www.wattcp.com/)
was initially based upon TinyTcp. Later, WATTCP was forked by Gisle
Vanem into [Watt-32](https://www.watt-32.net/), to add 32-bit support.
